---Task A-------
See 'Out.linspline.sin.svg' and 'Out.linspline.exp.svg': The linear spline and integrator are tested for the sin function and exp function.

---Task B-------
See Out.qspline.func1.svg: Shows the quadratic interpolation (implemented by the qspline evaluate function), the integral of the interpolation and the derivative of the interpolation applied to a constant function, a linear function and a quadratic function.
The coefficients b_i and c_i of the plotted quadratic-splines calculated by the qspline class ( s_i(x) = y_i + b_i(x - x_i) + c_i(x - x_i)^2) :
Coefficents of constant function:
c =          0          0          0          0 
b =          0          0          0          0 
Coefficents of linear function:
c =          0          0          0          0 
b =          4          4          4          4 
Coefficents of quadratic function:
c =          0          2          0          2 
b =          1          1          5          5
