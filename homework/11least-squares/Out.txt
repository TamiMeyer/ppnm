---Task A and B- and C-------
Fit the experimental data with exponential function in the usual logarithmic way and determine the uncertainties in the fitting coefficients: (See Out.experiment_fitted.data)
ln(t)=ln(a)-λ*t with ln(a) = 4.9587 ± 0.0354 and λ = 0.1706 ± 0.0072

Half-life time of ThX from fitted experimental data: T½ = ln(2)/λ = 4.062 days ± 0.170
Half-life time of 224Ra: 3.632 days (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_radium)
Conclusion: The half-life value for ThX from the given data does not agree with the modern value within the estimated uncertainty.
