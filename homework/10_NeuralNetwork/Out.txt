---Task A-------
Number of hidden neurons: 6
The network is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
The resulting network parameters are: (-1.57,0.44,0.732,-0.0809,0.426,0.776,0.787,0.593,16.7,0.449,10.4,5.21,6.55,-2.25,-4.8,1.75,9.27,5.53)
