---Task A-------
Number of hidden neurons: 5
Starting network parameters are: (   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1)

The network is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
The resulting network parameters are: (1.26,2.67,0.843,0.997,1.15,0.285,0.658,0.175,0.157,0.26,1.16,0.784,0.905,0.125,0.762)
