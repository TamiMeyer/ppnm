---Task A-------
Number of hidden neurons: 5
Starting network parameters are: (   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.43)

The network is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
The resulting network parameters are: (0.278,0.0109,-0.322,-0.0128,0.000578,0.235,2.38,0.303,0.309,0.842,0.707,-0.0307,1.96,3.04,-1.2)
