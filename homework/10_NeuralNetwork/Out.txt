---Task A-------
Number of hidden neurons: 6
The network is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
The resulting network parameters are: (0.897,3.82,0.0281,-0.36,0.64,-0.0473,1.63,2.84,0.741,0.366,0.879, 0.5,0.644,-0.927,-3.88,0.511,0.487,4.97)
