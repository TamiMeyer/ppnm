---Task A-------
Number of hidden neurons: 6
Starting network parameters are: (   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,0.0604,0.0604,0.0604,0.0604,0.0604,0.0604)

The network is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
The resulting network parameters are: (0.0549,1.02,0.285,0.51,0.962,4.93,0.311,0.645,0.275,0.422,0.801,10.6,-3.19,-30.1,-2.14,-10.5,28.7,-1.43)
