---Task A-------
1.The network (6 hidden neurons) is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
For debugging: The resulting network parameters (shifts ai, scales bi, weight-factors wi) are: (0.408,1.75,-1.13,-1.34,-0.58,0.81,0.458,-0.693,-0.607,0.152,-0.439,0.58,-2.13,1.61,1.43,-4.42,1.84,-0.906)

2.Response data of the network in the interval [-1,1] is produced and can be found in 'Out.response.data'.
See 'Out.response_taskA.svg': 
        The training data points are plot and the resulting response.
