---Task A-------
1.The network (6 hidden neurons) is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
For debugging: The resulting network parameters (shifts ai, scales bi, weight-factors wi) are: (-1.24,-1.45,-0.0933,0.381,-1.25,-0.65,-0.572,0.903,-0.96,0.525,0.462,0.658,-5.51,-1.44,-2.51,-3.43,-3.12,-2.94)

2.Response data of the network in the interval [-1,1] is produced and can be found in 'Out.response.data'.
See 'Out.response_taskA.svg': 
        The training data points are plot and the resulting response.
