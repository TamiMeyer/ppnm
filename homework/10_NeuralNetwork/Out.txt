---Task A-------
Number of hidden neurons: 6
Starting network parameters are: (   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,-0.277,-0.277,-0.277,-0.277,-0.277,-0.277)

The network is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
The resulting network parameters are: (0.499,-0.66,0.0402,-0.266,2.29,0.00722,0.371,0.453,0.306,0.326,0.362,0.304,-1.23,-0.873,-0.79,0.853,1.02,1.52)
