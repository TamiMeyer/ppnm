---Task A-------
1.The network (6 hidden neurons) is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
For debugging: The resulting network parameters (shifts ai, scales bi, weight-factors wi) are: (-1.03,-0.107,0.964, 1.2,1.98,-0.75,0.61,0.506,0.521,1.09,2.04,2.03,1.43,3.41,1.33,0.197,-1.64,-2.37)

2.Response data of the network in the interval [-1,1] is produced and can be found in 'Out.response.data'.
See 'Out.response_taskA.svg': 
        The training data points are plot and the resulting response.
