---Task A-------
1.The network (6 hidden neurons) is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
For debugging: The resulting network parameters (shifts ai, scales bi, weight-factors wi) are: ( 1.6,1.01,0.765,-0.471,-0.174,1.33,-0.484,-1.19,0.349,0.498,-0.535,-0.814,1.89,1.76,0.483,-1.79,-2.93,-2.95)

2.Response data of the network in the interval [-1,1] is produced and can be found in 'Out.response.data'.
See 'Out.response_taskA.svg': 
        The training data points are plot and the resulting response.
