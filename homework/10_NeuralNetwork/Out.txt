---Task A-------
1.The network (6 hidden neurons) is trained to approximate the function g(x)=Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x) with the data from 'Out.train.data'.
For debugging: The resulting network parameters (shifts ai, scales bi, weight-factors wi) are: (-1.14,0.478,0.374,0.734,-0.0879,2.42,-0.725,0.555,-1.22,0.724,0.538,-1.35,-1.66,-1.24,1.51,3.32,4.25,-1.06)

2.Response data of the network in the interval [-1,1] is produced and can be found in 'Out.response.data'.
See 'Out.response_taskA.svg': 
        The training data points are plot and the resulting response.
