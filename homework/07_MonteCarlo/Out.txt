---Task A-------
See 'Out.mc2D_pseudo.svg': 
        The estimated error and the actual error as functions of the number of sampling points are plot for the calculation of the area of a unit circle by pseudo-random monte carlo integration
        and for calculation of the area of an ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axis of length 2 and 1.
        It is shown that the actual error scales as 1/√N

area of unit circle calculated with pseudo-random mc (49550 sampling points): result=3.144702, estimated error=0.007368, actual error=0.003110, analytic: π

area of ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axis of length 2 and 1, calculated with pseudo-random mc (49550 sampling points): result=6.286660, estimated error=0.014744, actual error=0.003475, analytic: 2π

∫0π  dx/π ∫0π  dy/π ∫0π  dz/π [1-cos(x)cos(y)cos(z)]^-1 = Γ(1/4)4/(4π3) calculated with pseudo-random mc (50000 sampling points): result=1.375533, estimated error=0.009111, actual error=0.017671, analytic:1.393204 

---Task B-------
See 'Out.ellipse_pseudo_quasi.svg':
        The estimated and actual errors for the calculation of the area of an ellipse are compare for pseudo and quasi random M.C.
        The errors of the quasi random method are in general smaller.

area of unit circle calculated with quasi-random mc (49550 sampling points): result=3.142402, estimated error=0.000727, actual error=0.000809, analytic: π

area of ellipse calculated with quasi-random mc (49550 sampling points): result=6.284803, estimated error=0.001453, actual error=0.001618, analytic: 2π
