---Task A-------
See 'Out.mc2D_pseudo.svg': 
        The estimated error and the actual error as functions of the number of sampling points are plot for the calculation of the area of a unit circle by pseudo-random monte carlo integration
        and for calculation of the area of an ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axis of length 2 and 1.
        It is shown that the actual error scales as 1/√N

area of unit circle calculated with pseudo-random mc (10000 sampling points): result=3.1344, estimated error=0.0164716017436071, analytic: π

area of ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axis of length 2 and 1, calculated with pseudo-random mc (10000 sampling points): result=6.28, estimated error=0.0328657876826344, analytic: 2π

 ∫0π  dx/π ∫0π  dy/π ∫0π  dz/π [1-cos(x)cos(y)cos(z)]^-1 = Γ(1/4)4/(4π3) calculated with pseudo-random mc (50000 sampling points): result=1.39198739355847, estimated error=0.00889703006009454, analytic: 1.393204
