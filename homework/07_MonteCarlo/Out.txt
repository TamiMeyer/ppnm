---Task A-------
See 'Out.mc2D_pseudo.svg': 
        The estimated error and the actual error as functions of the number of sampling points are plot for the calculation of the area of a unit circle by pseudo-random monte carlo integration
        and for calculation of the area of an ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axis of length 2 and 1.
        It is shown that the actual error scales as 1/√N

area of unit circle calculated with pseudo-random mc (49550 sampling points): result=3.138083, estimated error=0.007388, actual error=0.003510, analytic: π

area of ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axis of length 2 and 1, calculated with pseudo-random mc (49550 sampling points): result=6.286337, estimated error=0.014745, actual error=0.003152, analytic: 2π

∫0π  dx/π ∫0π  dy/π ∫0π  dz/π [1-cos(x)cos(y)cos(z)]^-1 = Γ(1/4)4/(4π3) calculated with pseudo-random mc (50000 sampling points): result=1.379967, estimated error=0.006642, actual error=0.013237, analytic:1.393204 

---Task B-------
See 'Out.ellipse_pseudo_quasi.svg':
        The estimated and actual errors for the calculation of the area of the ellipse are compare for pseudo and quasi random M.C.
        Thee same is done for the area of a unit circle.
        The errors of the quasi random method are in general smaller.

area of ellipse calculated with quasi-random mc (49550 sampling points): result=6.285530, estimated error=0.001453, actual error=0.002344, analytic: 2π
