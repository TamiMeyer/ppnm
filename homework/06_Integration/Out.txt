---Task A-------
The implementation of the integrate function is tested
and checked that my integrator returns results within the given accuracy goals:

∫₀¹ dx √(x) =  0.6670     Expected: 2/3   Within the given accuracy goals?: True
∫₀¹ dx 1/√(x) =  2.0000     Expected: 2    Within the given accuracy goals?: True
∫₀¹ dx 4√(1-x²) =  3.1418     Expected: π     Within the given accuracy goals?: True
∫₀¹ dx ln(x)/√(x) = - 3.9999     Expected: -4    Within the given accuracy goals?: True

See 'Out.integ_erf.svg':
        Compares the integrator implemented error function, the single precision error function from the plots exercise and some tabulated values for the error function.
