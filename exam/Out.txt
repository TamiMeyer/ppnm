---Task A-------
The least-squares signal smoothing is implemented using QR-decomposition to solve the linear equation A*y_smooth=y_raw. 

Example of matrix D: The second derivative of a discrete signal is approximated by its secondorder difference, Dx,
where the matrix D (e.g. for a set of 5 datapoints) is given as:
D = 
         1         -2          1          0          0 
         0          1         -2          1          0 
         0          0          1         -2          1 

Example of matrix A for smoothing parameter lambda = 1 and 5 data points:
A = 1+Î»D^TD =  
         2         -2          1          0          0 
        -2          6         -4          1          0 
         1         -4          7         -4          1 
         0          1         -4          6         -2 
         0          0          1         -2          2

        The figure shows a noisy signal (generated by chatGPT) and the smoothened signal 
        (using QR-decomposition) with 3 different smoothing parameters lambda.

---Task B-------
See 'Out.smoothQR_generated.svg':
        Signal with random noise is generated. And the smoothing with QR-decomposition is applied.
