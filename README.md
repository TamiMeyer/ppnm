The folders of each homework and the folder of the exam contain a file 'Out.txt' which guides the reader through my results and solutions of the tasks.

Exam project: Implement least-squares signal smoothing as described in the Book.
Exam structure:
- The least-squares signal smoothing is implemented using Gram-Schmidt QR-decomposition
- A noisy signal is generated by adding random noise to clean signals
- The least-squares signal smoothing is implemented using LU-decomposition
- A more efficient LU least-squares signal smoothing is implemented by making use of the banded structure and symmetries of the involved matrices.
- The QR-smoothing, LU-smoothing and efficient LU-smoothing is applied to the generated data.
- The operation time of smoothing with QR-decomposition ('smoothQR') is compared to  the efficient LU-factorization smoothing ('smoothLU_eff'), for several noisy data sets of different length N.
